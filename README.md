# CloudFormation Templates
This repo groups templates for using with [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/). CloudFormation is a service for provisioning resources that implements the concept of [infrastructure as code - IaC](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/?nc1=f_cc#iac). Therefore, a given infrastructure can be created and deleted automatically.

Each folder holds a set of examples. Hopefully, folder names are self-explanatory ;)
